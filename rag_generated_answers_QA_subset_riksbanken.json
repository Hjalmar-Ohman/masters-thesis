        "generated_answer": "In the property sector, borrowing primarily occurs through the issuance of debt securities, which has become a significant source of financing. This trend is largely influenced by the favorable conditions created by low interest rates following the financial crisis, which have encouraged investors to seek riskier assets, such as those in the property sector. Consequently, property companies are notable for their dominance in securities borrowing compared to medium-sized and small companies.\n\nIn contrast, medium-sized and small companies typically rely more heavily on traditional bank loans for their financing needs. This reliance on bank loans indicates a preference for more straightforward and possibly lower-cost borrowing options, as opposed to the securities market, which may be less accessible for smaller firms.\n\nOverall, while the property sector leans more towards securities for financing, medium-sized and small companies primarily utilize bank loans, reflecting different financial strategies and access to capital markets based on their size and operational needs.",

It does this by issuing debt securities. These include differ-ent types of bonds such as government and municipal bonds, which have longer ma-turities, and treasury bills and certificates, which have shorter maturities. In Sweden, the Swedish National Debt Office manages government borrowing and issues govern-ment bonds and treasury bills.

The ma-jority of this consisted of government bonds, but some, around SEK 250 billion, also consisted of municipal bonds issued by municipalities and regions. For municipalities and regions, the credit market company Kommuninvest, an economic association owned and governed by its members, which are municipalities and regions, also bor-rows approximately SEK 250 billion.27 Some funding, around SEK 100 billion, also comes from borrowing from banks and intergovernmental organisations.28  At the end of 2023, Sweden’s central government debt was just under 20 percent of GDP, see Figure 14. In the 2000s, central government debt fell sharply from the level  26 As the value of an equity depends on the company’s performance and the market’s expectations of fu-ture performance, this figure differs from the value of the equity capital the company raised at the begin-ning, so a direct comparison of the size of the interest-bearing debt is not entirely accurate. 27 Source: www.kommuninvest.se/download/18.e6f1d6318fa4a7c94d1fd4e/1716973996911/Kommunin-vest Annual Report 2023 (xhtml).xhtml  28 Source: https://kommuninvest.se/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Den-kommunala-laneskulden-2023.pdf  (In Swedish only)",
