This includes loans from domestic banks as well as other financial institutions.\n\n2. **Debt Securities**: There has been a notable increase in the issuance of debt securities, particularly among larger firms. This is often preferred due to the lower costs associated with issuing securities in a favorable interest rate environment. The majority of the investment in these securities comes from foreign investors, followed by Swedish funds.\n\n3. **Equity Capital**: Companies also utilize equity capital for financing, with a market value of outstanding equities surpassing SEK 21,000 billion by the end of 2023. This includes both listed and unlisted equities, with a significant portion of investment in listed equities coming from foreign investors.\n\nOverall, while large enterprises benefit from a mix of financing sources, the trend towards securities issuance seems to be growing, particularly in sectors such as energy, water supply, and property operations, where securities borrowing is more prevalent.",

The text indicates that property companies lead in securities borrowing, especially in comparison to other industries. This trend is influenced by the favorable conditions of low interest rates that followed the financial crisis, which made it more attractive for investors to engage in riskier assets and for companies to finance themselves through securities rather than traditional bank loans.\n\nConversely, medium-sized and small companies typically have a greater reliance on bank loans for their financing needs. This distinction highlights how larger companies, particularly in sectors like property, have more access to diverse financial instruments such as debt securities, while smaller firms often face limitations and thus turn to traditional lending sources.",

It does this by issuing debt securities. These include differ-ent types of bonds such as government and municipal bonds, which have longer ma-turities, and treasury bills and certificates, which have shorter maturities. In Sweden, the Swedish National Debt Office manages government borrowing and issues govern-ment bonds and treasury bills.

The ma-jority of this consisted of government bonds, but some, around SEK 250 billion, also consisted of municipal bonds issued by municipalities and regions. For municipalities and regions, the credit market company Kommuninvest, an economic association owned and governed by its members, which are municipalities and regions, also bor-rows approximately SEK 250 billion.27 Some funding, around SEK 100 billion, also comes from borrowing from banks and intergovernmental organisations.28  At the end of 2023, Sweden’s central government debt was just under 20 percent of GDP, see Figure 14. In the 2000s, central government debt fell sharply from the level  26 As the value of an equity depends on the company’s performance and the market’s expectations of fu-ture performance, this figure differs from the value of the equity capital the company raised at the begin-ning, so a direct comparison of the size of the interest-bearing debt is not entirely accurate. 27 Source: www.kommuninvest.se/download/18.e6f1d6318fa4a7c94d1fd4e/1716973996911/Kommunin-vest Annual Report 2023 (xhtml).xhtml  28 Source: https://kommuninvest.se/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Den-kommunala-laneskulden-2023.pdf  (In Swedish only)",
