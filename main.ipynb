It does this by issuing debt securities. These include differ-ent types of bonds such as government and municipal bonds, which have longer ma-turities, and treasury bills and certificates, which have shorter maturities. In Sweden, the Swedish National Debt Office manages government borrowing and issues govern-ment bonds and treasury bills. At the end of 2023, the outstanding stock of issued public sector securities amounted to almost SEK 1,200 billion, see Figure 13. The ma-jority of this consisted of government bonds, but some, around SEK 250 billion, also consisted of municipal bonds issued by municipalities and regions. For municipalities and regions, the credit market company Kommuninvest, an economic association owned and governed by its members, which are municipalities and regions, also bor-rows approximately SEK 250 billion.27 Some funding, around SEK 100 billion, also comes from borrowing from banks and intergovernmental organisations.28  At the end of 2023, Sweden’s central government debt was just under 20 percent of GDP, see Figure 14. In the 2000s, central government debt fell sharply from the level  26 As the value of an equity depends on the company’s performance and the market’s expectations of fu-ture performance, this figure differs from the value of the equity capital the company raised at the begin-ning, so a direct comparison of the size of the interest-bearing debt is not entirely accurate. 27 Source: www.kommuninvest.se/download/18.e6f1d6318fa4a7c94d1fd4e/1716973996911/Kommunin-vest Annual Report 2023 (xhtml).xhtml  28 Source: https://kommuninvest.se/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Den-kommunala-laneskulden-2023.pdf  (In Swedish only)', 'page_number': 5}, {'type': 'text', 'content': 'The real economy’s need for financial services \\n20 Figure 8.

They are also linked to different actors by making recurrent payments and in the context of different payment  services, as described in more detail in the section Financial infrastructures enable payments.  1.3 Public sector Central government and municipalities fund themselves by issuing debt securities In addition to raising money through various taxes, the public sector uses the capital market to obtain funding. It does this by issuing debt securities. These include differ-ent types of bonds such as government and municipal bonds, which have longer ma-turities, and treasury bills and certificates, which have shorter maturities. In Sweden, the Swedish National Debt Office manages government borrowing and issues govern-ment bonds and treasury bills. At the end of 2023, the outstanding stock of issued public sector securities amounted to almost SEK 1,200 billion, see Figure 13.

For municipalities and regions, the credit market company Kommuninvest, an economic association owned and governed by its members, which are municipalities and regions, also bor-rows approximately SEK 250 billion.27 Some funding, around SEK 100 billion, also comes from borrowing from banks and intergovernmental organisations.28  At the end of 2023, Sweden’s central government debt was just under 20 percent of GDP, see Figure 14.
