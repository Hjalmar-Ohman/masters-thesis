[{"type": "text", "content": "The economic situation \n8 Policy rate cut by 0.25 percentage points to 3.25 per cent The Riksbank has gradually eased monetary policy as the inflation outlook has brightened. The policy rate was cut in May and August, at the same time as the Riksbank communicated that further cuts could be expected during the remainder of the year.  The interest rate cuts have contributed to lower interest rates for households and companies. Since the beginning of the year, the variable mortgage rates charged to households have fallen around as much as the policy rate. Mortgage rates with longer maturities have fallen more than variable ones, which largely reflects expectations of a lower policy rate going forward. Companies are also facing a lower lending rate than in the spring. It is important that rate cuts also continue to have the expected impact on other interest rates in the economy and the Riksbank is following developments closely. Conditions are right for a recovery in the Swedish economy but it looks like it will take slightly longer than expected. Monetary policy has contributed to inflation now being close to the target. Low and stable inflation and falling interest rates improve households\u2019 finances and make it easier for companies to invest. Despite an expec-tation among economic agents of better times ahead, there are few clear signs as yet of a recovery in the Swedish economy. It is important in itself that economic activity strengthens soon, but it is also a necessary condition for inflation to stabilise around the target.  Over the year, inflation has shown increasing signs of stabilising around two per cent. In addition, the risk of excessive inflation has gradually decreased. Unusually low energy prices are expected to lead to CPIF inflation being below two per cent for a few months more before stabilising around the target over the course of next year. However, the development of energy prices is highly uncertain and may lead to CPIF inflation becoming higher or lower than forecast.3 It is assessed that the policy rate can be cut at a faster pace than previously communicated. The Executive Board has decided to cut the policy rate by 0.25 per-centage points to 3.25 per cent. If the outlook for inflation and economic activity remains unchanged, the policy rate may also be cut at the two remaining meetings this year. The forecast for the policy rate reflects that a cut of 0.5 percentage points at one of the coming meetings is possible. It also indicates that one or two further cuts may be made during the first half of 2025 (see Figure 1).", "page_number": 1}, {"type": "text", "content": "Together, these changes imply a relatively large shift of monetary policy in a more expansionary direction, which will improve households\u2019 finances and make it easier for companies to invest.

Many central banks, including the ECB and Federal Reserve, have cut their policy rates once or several times and more cuts are expected. GDP in the euro area increased during the first half of 2024, after remaining in principle unchanged since the end of 2022. In the United States, GDP has long been strong, but there are now signs of a slowdown and unemployment has risen.  In Sweden, CPIF inflation was 1.2 per cent in August due to low energy prices. Measured in terms of the CPIF excluding energy, inflation was 2.2 per cent. Companies\u2019 pricing plans and long-term inflation expec-tations indicate that inflation will remain close to 2 per cent going for-ward. Swedish GDP decreased slightly in the second quarter and the labour market is weaker than normal, although indicators suggest that the downturn is close to bottoming out.  The transmission of the Riksbank\u2019s monetary policy to the interest rates faced by households and companies is considered to be working well.

During the second quarter, GDP rose by 0.2 per cent compared with the first quarter (see Figure 3). Both household consumption and in particular gross fixed investment declined, however, and growth was primarily driven by a positive net export. Growth in the euro area differs substantially between countries; for instance GDP fell somewhat in Germany during the second quarter, while it rose fairly significantly in Spain. Indicators for the business sector give a mixed impression, with the purchasing managers\u2019 index in the services sector indicating growth, although marginally, while it looks weaker in the manufacturing sector (see Figure 3).

The increase in employment according to Nonfarm Payrolls has slowed down significantly, and US unemployment has risen over the past year, although it fell marginally in August to 4.2 per cent.

Inflation is on the way down but inflation in service prices is still high In August, HICP inflation in the euro area fell to 2.2 per cent. The downturn can largely be explained by a lower rate of increase in energy prices (see Figure 5). Since the end of last year, the annual rate of increase for services prices has been at around 4 per cent, which is substantially higher than normal (see Figure 6).5 Agreed wage increases in the euro area slowed down during the second quarter but, in several countries, wages are still rising at a relatively rapid pace, which contributes to maintaining the rate of increase in service prices. This includes Germany.  In the United States, CPI inflation has continued to fall and was 2.5 per cent in August. One reason for this is the lower rate of increase for energy prices, as well as the slower increase of services prices excluding rents and energy in recent months at the same time as the rate of increase in prices for goods has remained low. Moreover, other prices are now increasing at a more moderate pace. In terms of the PCE, inflation was 2.5 per cent in July.6 US wage growth has slowed down over the last year. In addition, commodity prices have fallen on the world market and inflation expectations have slowed down in both the euro area and United States. This suggests lower inflationary pressures in the period ahead.  \n 5 The average annual change in services prices since January 2000 is 2.1 per cent in the euro area, 3.0 per cent in the United States and 2.3 per cent in Sweden.  6 PCE is the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation.

On 12 September, the ECB cut its deposit rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.5 per cent.7 The ECB emphasises that it is unwilling to commit to a certain interest rate path in advance and that interest rate decisions will be taken on a meeting by meeting basis.  The Federal Reserve cut its policy rate on 18 September for the first time since March 2020. At its meeting, the target interval for the Federal funds rate was cut by 0.5 per-centage points to 4.75-5.00 per cent. The central bank communicated that the upside risks for inflation have declined and that the downside risks for the labour market have increased, and that it is therefore appropriate to begin easing monetary policy to avoid an overly weak economic development. The Federal Reserve emphasises that they are not following a predetermined interest rate path, but will take decisions one meeting at a time. The FOMC members\u2019 own assessments of the future policy rate, illustrated by the \u2018dot-plot\u2019, were lowered for 2024 and 2025 and indicate a policy rate of 4.4 per cent before the end of the year and 3.4 per cent at the end of 2025.8  Figure 7.

During the spring, these expectations were reversed, largely due to surprisingly high inflation outcomes and stronger economic activity. Over the summer, market expectations have shifted down again apace with clearer signs of lower inflation outcomes and economic slow-down. The expectations of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy have varied substantially, with market pricing having shifted several times in response to new economic outcomes. According to the pricing of futures contracts for short-term money market rates, market participants expect the Federal Reserve to cut the policy rate by around 1.7 percentage points until the middle of next year. For the ECB, expectations of rate cuts are somewhat lower. The ECB is expected to cut the deposit rate by around 1.3 percentage points over the same time period (see Figure 8). Figure 8.

Lower lending and deposit rates for households and companies As the Riksbank has cut its policy rate, the interest rates faced by households and companies have also fallen. Since the start of the year, the average mortgage rate on new loans has fallen by about as much as the Riksbank has so far cut the policy rate (see Figure 10).10 For mortgage rates on loans with a longer maturity that also include expectations of lower interest rates going forward, mortgage rates have fallen more than the policy rate, however (see Figure 11). For instance, the average rate on new mortgages with a fixed interest period of between one and three years has fallen by around one percentage point since the beginning of 2024.

Continuing weak labour market  Unemployment has risen since the end of 2022 (see Figure 4). The low demand in the economy and labour market indicators all point to the continuing relatively weak development of the labour market in the near term. The number of redundancy notices and bankruptcies is on an elevated level and the number of newly-registered vacancies has fallen significantly. On the other hand, recruitment plans are weakly positive, with the service sector in particular planning new recruitment.  Recession close to bottom Resource utilisation in the Swedish economy is currently assessed to be somewhat lower than normal and the economy is in mild recession. One way of estimating resource utilisation is to assess the size of the gap between actual and potential levels for GDP, for example, known as the GDP gap. Another indicator of resource utilisation is the view taken by companies of the current demand situation, which is measured regularly by the National Institute of Economic Research. The Riksbank's assessment is that the GDP gap is lower than normal, which corresponds well to the current demand situation (see Figure 15). The Riksbank\u2019s resource utilisation indicator, the RU indica-tor, which weighs together various indicators, also suggests that resource utilisation has fallen and is marginally below normal. But indicators for growth have risen since the start of the year and are starting to approach levels compatible with normal growth.

ANALYSIS \u2013 Microdata gives insights into how companies adjust their prices One way of gaining an understanding of how companies adjust their prices is to investigate how often and by how much prices change for products included in the consumer price index (CPI). The results show that it is primarily the frequency, and not the magnitude, of price changes that correlates with the rate of inflation. This was evident in 2022 and 2023, when inflation was high. At that time, companies increased their prices much more frequently than before, while the average size of price changes did not change much. As inflation has fallen, companies have also started to change their prices less frequently. This indicates that pricing behaviour is now more in line with what it was before the period of high inflation. To understand what affects inflation, it is important to understand how companies set their prices and whether and, if so, how this changes under different economic circumstances.", "page_number": 17}, {"type": "text", "content": "There are studies indicating that the pass-through to consumer prices", "page_number": 17}, {"type": "text", "content": "The economic situation \n25 from companies\u2019 changed costs is greater when inflation and demand are high.13 Such changes in companies\u2019 costs could, for example, be changes in the prices of their input goods or wage costs.  A study by the National Institute of Economic Research (NIER) showed that Swedish companies, on average, raised their prices in line with how their costs rose in the period from 2019 to the second quarter of 2023.14 Historically, however, companies have tended to even out price changes and allow part of their cost changes to be absorbed by profit margins, but this did not occur during the period of rising inflation in 2022 and 2023. This indicates that this part of companies\u2019 price-setting behaviour changed during the period of high inflation. Here, we study another aspect of companies\u2019 price-setting behaviour, namely by how much and how often companies change their prices. Using a large data set, we have studied in detail how prices change for the products included in the consumer price index (CPI).15 Figure 16 shows that the gap between the frequency of price rises and that of price reductions increased strongly during the period of high inflation but that, as of the start of 2024, it seems to have been at about the same level as it was before inflation started to rise. The development in the high inflation period was thus primarily driven by an upswing in how often companies raised their prices. In contrast, the development of the average size of price movements was relatively stable and did not change particularly much.16 17 \n 13 See, for instance, C. Borio, M. Lombardi, J. Yetman and E.

The data set used covers about 75 per cent of the total weight of the CPI and includes about 9 million price observations from 2010 on. The material allows the prices of individual products to be followed month by month to see if they change and, if so, by how much. From there, product and product group weights can be used to create aggregate mea-sures of the frequency of price increases and decreases, and measures of the magnitude of price changes. 17 These results are in line with similar studies in other countries. See, for example, the article \u201cAnalyzing businesses\u2019 price-setting behaviour\u201d in Bank of Canada\u2019s Monetary Policy Report from April 2024. The result is also in line with how companies in the Riksbank\u2019s Business Survey responded in 2022, when they reported that they were adjusting prices more frequently than usual.

Sources: Statistics Sweden and the Riksbank. The same pattern can be seen when the subgroups food and other goods are examined in the CPI. However, for services prices the relationships are different. Among services prices, the rate of price increase remains high and companies are changing their prices more frequently than usual.18 Municipal taxes and rents are examples of service prices that have increased more than usual. This is assessed to be primarily due to the cost increases that took place in 2022 and 2023, rather than the demand and cost developments taking place presently. As inflation has become normalised, so too has the frequency of price changes. One lesson that can be learned for the future is that it is important to spot early signs that companies are starting to adjust their prices more frequently during periods of major changes in costs and high demand. One source of such information, for example, could be the Riksbank\u2019s own Business Surveys. Early in 2022, companies in the Survey stated that they were adjusting prices more frequently than usual and that it was easier than usual to gain acceptance from customers for increased prices.19 \n 18 M.
