The downturn can largely \nbe explained by a lower rate of increase in energy prices (see Figure 5).

This includes Germany.  \nIn the United States, CPI inflation has continued to fall and  was 2.5 per cent in August. \nOne reason for this is the lower rate of increase for energy prices, as well as the \nslower increase of services prices excluding rents and energy in recent months at the \nsame time as the rate of increase in prices for goods has  remained low. Moreover, \nother prices are now increasing at a more moderate pace. In terms of the PCE, \ninflation was 2.5 per cent in July.6 US wage growth has slowed down over the last \nyear.

Another indicator of resource utilisation \nis the view taken by companies of the current demand situation, which is measured \nregularly by the National Institu te of Economic Research. The Riksbank's assessment is \nthat the GDP gap is lower than normal, which corresponds well to the current demand \nsituation (see Figure 15). The Riksbank\u2019s resource utilisation indicator, the RU indica -\ntor, which weighs together var ious indicators, also suggests that resource utilisation \nhas fallen and is marginally below normal.
