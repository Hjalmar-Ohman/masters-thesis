This access provides them with more diverse financing options and potentially lower costs of capital. In contrast, SMEs typically rely on bank loans, private equity, or personal savings, as they may not have the scale or reputation to attract investment from capital markets.\n\n2. **Creditworthiness**: Large enterprises generally have established credit histories and stronger financial positions, making them more attractive to lenders. This allows them to secure loans at lower interest rates and on more favorable terms. SMEs, on the other hand, may face higher interest rates due to perceived higher risks and may also struggle to meet the collateral requirements set by banks.\n\n3. **Financing Needs**: The financing needs of large enterprises tend to be more complex and varied compared to SMEs. Large companies may seek financing for substantial projects, acquisitions, or expansions requiring significant capital. SMEs often seek financing for day-to-day operations, working capital, or small-scale investments, which may result in shorter-term borrowing.\n\n4. **Use of Equity Capital**: As mentioned, the market value of companies' outstanding equities in Sweden is substantial.
