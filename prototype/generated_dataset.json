        "response": "As of December 31, 2023, the size of non-financial companies in Sweden significantly influences their borrowing patterns. Larger companies tend to have greater access to diverse financing options, including loans and securities, due to their established creditworthiness and financial stability. Consequently, they are often able to secure loans at more favorable terms compared to smaller firms.\n\nAccording to the data presented in Figure 11, the borrowing volume among non-financial companies varies by sector, with larger firms in sectors such as manufacturing and technology likely commanding a substantial share of total borrowing. In contrast, smaller companies may face challenges in obtaining funding, which can limit their growth and operational capabilities. \n\nThe primary source of loans for these companies remains financial corporations, particularly banks, which account for over 70% of the total loan volume. This reliance on bank financing underscores the importance of maintaining strong relationships with financial institutions, especially for larger firms that can leverage their size to negotiate better loan conditions.\n\nOverall, the size of non-financial companies in Sweden plays a crucial role in their borrowing behaviors, with larger companies enjoying more advantageous terms and access to a wider range of financial products, while smaller firms may need to explore alternative financing options or face higher borrowing costs.",
