At the end of 2023, the mar-ket value of companies’ outstanding equities amounted to just over SEK 21,000 bil-lion, equivalent to around 340 percent of GDP. Of this, just over a third were listed eq-uities and the rest unlisted.26 Foreign investors account for the largest share of invest-ment in listed equities. This is followed by Swedish funds, non-financial companies and households, see Figure 12. There are also venture capital companies that invest in companies’ equity capital, but this is mainly in unlisted companies. Read more in the section Private equity firms. Companies are linked to different actors in more ways than through their savings and financing. They also enter into various types of derivative contract with banks to hedge against changes in, for example, commodity prices, exchange rates or interest rates, see Figure 4 above for an overview of the links. They are also linked to different actors by making recurrent payments and in the context of different payment  services, as described in more detail in the section Financial infrastructures enable payments.  1.3 Public sector Central government and municipalities fund themselves by issuing debt securities In addition to raising money through various taxes, the public sector uses the capital market to obtain funding. It does this by issuing debt securities. These include differ-ent types of bonds such as government and municipal bonds, which have longer ma-turities, and treasury bills and certificates, which have shorter maturities. In Sweden, the Swedish National Debt Office manages government borrowing and issues govern-ment bonds and treasury bills. At the end of 2023, the outstanding stock of issued public sector securities amounted to almost SEK 1,200 billion, see Figure 13. The ma-jority of this consisted of government bonds, but some, around SEK 250 billion, also consisted of municipal bonds issued by municipalities and regions. For municipalities and regions, the credit market company Kommuninvest, an economic association owned and governed by its members, which are municipalities and regions, also bor-rows approximately SEK 250 billion.27 Some funding, around SEK 100 billion, also comes from borrowing from banks and intergovernmental organisations.28  At the end of 2023, Sweden’s central government debt was just under 20 percent of GDP, see Figure 14. In the 2000s, central government debt fell sharply from the level  26 As the value of an equity depends on the company’s performance and the market’s expectations of fu-ture performance, this figure differs from the value of the equity capital the company raised at the begin-ning, so a direct comparison of the size of the interest-bearing debt is not entirely accurate. 27 Source: www.kommuninvest.se/download/18.e6f1d6318fa4a7c94d1fd4e/1716973996911/Kommunin-vest Annual Report 2023 (xhtml).xhtml  28 Source: https://kommuninvest.se/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Den-kommunala-laneskulden-2023.pdf  (In Swedish only)', 'The real economy’s need for financial services \\n20 Figure 8.

The highest share of securities borrowing is for companies active in energy and water supply, certain in-dustrial and property operations and certain service industries, see Figure 11. In terms of volume, property companies dominate securities borrowing. Companies in con-struction, trade, hotels and tourism mainly take out loans to finance their activities.  Figure 11.

Companies’ loans mostly come from financial corporations, mainly banks, which ac-count for more than 70 percent of the loan volume, but other financial companies also contribute to some extent. In addition, loans come mainly from municipalities and regions and from foreign lenders.23 The debt securities issued by companies are mainly corporate bonds, but also com-mercial papers to some extent. Commercial papers have shorter maturities, up to one year, and bonds have longer maturities. Large, investment-grade Swedish companies account for most of the issue volumes on the corporate bond market. In recent years, however, more and more companies have chosen to issue bonds, including smaller, companies with a high yield credit rating As a consequence, the share of issuance by  23 Banks here refer to monetary financial institutions (MFIs) operating in Sweden, such as banks and credit market companies.

One contributing factor may be the low interest rates that followed the financial crisis, which lowered absolute re-turns and increased investor demand for riskier assets, as well as making the price of securities financing more favourable compared with the price of bank loans.  It is mainly foreign actors who invest in the debt securities issued by companies, fol-lowed by Swedish funds and Swedish insurance and pension companies, see Figure 12. The Riksbank owned 0.4 percent of the securities at the end of 2023, having pur-chased corporate bonds and commercial papers between September 2020 and De-cember 2022 to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the Swedish economy.24,25 Figure 12.

For municipalities and regions, the credit market company Kommuninvest, an economic association owned and governed by its members, which are municipalities and regions, also bor-rows approximately SEK 250 billion.27 Some funding, around SEK 100 billion, also comes from borrowing from banks and intergovernmental organisations.28  At the end of 2023, Sweden’s central government debt was just under 20 percent of GDP, see Figure 14.

At the end of 2023, the mar-ket value of companies’ outstanding equities amounted to just over SEK 21,000 bil-lion, equivalent to around 340 percent of GDP. Of this, just over a third were listed eq-uities and the rest unlisted.26 Foreign investors account for the largest share of invest-ment in listed equities. This is followed by Swedish funds, non-financial companies and households, see Figure 12. There are also venture capital companies that invest in companies’ equity capital, but this is mainly in unlisted companies. Read more in the section Private equity firms. Companies are linked to different actors in more ways than through their savings and financing. They also enter into various types of derivative contract with banks to hedge against changes in, for example, commodity prices, exchange rates or interest rates, see Figure 4 above for an overview of the links. They are also linked to different actors by making recurrent payments and in the context of different payment  services, as described in more detail in the section Financial infrastructures enable payments.  1.3 Public sector Central government and municipalities fund themselves by issuing debt securities In addition to raising money through various taxes, the public sector uses the capital market to obtain funding. It does this by issuing debt securities. These include differ-ent types of bonds such as government and municipal bonds, which have longer ma-turities, and treasury bills and certificates, which have shorter maturities. In Sweden, the Swedish National Debt Office manages government borrowing and issues govern-ment bonds and treasury bills. At the end of 2023, the outstanding stock of issued public sector securities amounted to almost SEK 1,200 billion, see Figure 13. The ma-jority of this consisted of government bonds, but some, around SEK 250 billion, also consisted of municipal bonds issued by municipalities and regions. For municipalities and regions, the credit market company Kommuninvest, an economic association owned and governed by its members, which are municipalities and regions, also bor-rows approximately SEK 250 billion.27 Some funding, around SEK 100 billion, also comes from borrowing from banks and intergovernmental organisations.28  At the end of 2023, Sweden’s central government debt was just under 20 percent of GDP, see Figure 14. In the 2000s, central government debt fell sharply from the level  26 As the value of an equity depends on the company’s performance and the market’s expectations of fu-ture performance, this figure differs from the value of the equity capital the company raised at the begin-ning, so a direct comparison of the size of the interest-bearing debt is not entirely accurate. 27 Source: www.kommuninvest.se/download/18.e6f1d6318fa4a7c94d1fd4e/1716973996911/Kommunin-vest Annual Report 2023 (xhtml).xhtml  28 Source: https://kommuninvest.se/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Den-kommunala-laneskulden-2023.pdf  (In Swedish only)', 'The real economy’s need for financial services \\n23 unrated companies has also increased significantly.
