      "  User Input: What was the total amount of interest-bearing debt for Swedish non-financial companies at the end of 2023, and how does this compare to Sweden's annual GDP?\n",
      "  Retrieved Contexts: [{'type': 'text', 'content': 'The real economy’s need for financial services \\n24 Companies also use equity capital to finance themselves. At the end of 2023, the mar-ket value of companies’ outstanding equities amounted to just over SEK 21,000 bil-lion, equivalent to around 340 percent of GDP. Of this, just over a third were listed eq-uities and the rest unlisted.26 Foreign investors account for the largest share of invest-ment in listed equities. This is followed by Swedish funds, non-financial companies and households, see Figure 12. There are also venture capital companies that invest in companies’ equity capital, but this is mainly in unlisted companies. Read more in the section Private equity firms. Companies are linked to different actors in more ways than through their savings and financing. They also enter into various types of derivative contract with banks to hedge against changes in, for example, commodity prices, exchange rates or interest rates, see Figure 4 above for an overview of the links. They are also linked to different actors by making recurrent payments and in the context of different payment  services, as described in more detail in the section Financial infrastructures enable payments.  1.3 Public sector Central government and municipalities fund themselves by issuing debt securities In addition to raising money through various taxes, the public sector uses the capital market to obtain funding. It does this by issuing debt securities. These include differ-ent types of bonds such as government and municipal bonds, which have longer ma-turities, and treasury bills and certificates, which have shorter maturities. In Sweden, the Swedish National Debt Office manages government borrowing and issues govern-ment bonds and treasury bills. At the end of 2023, the outstanding stock of issued public sector securities amounted to almost SEK 1,200 billion, see Figure 13. The ma-jority of this consisted of government bonds, but some, around SEK 250 billion, also consisted of municipal bonds issued by municipalities and regions. For municipalities and regions, the credit market company Kommuninvest, an economic association owned and governed by its members, which are municipalities and regions, also bor-rows approximately SEK 250 billion.27 Some funding, around SEK 100 billion, also comes from borrowing from banks and intergovernmental organisations.28  At the end of 2023, Sweden’s central government debt was just under 20 percent of GDP, see Figure 14. In the 2000s, central government debt fell sharply from the level  26 As the value of an equity depends on the company’s performance and the market’s expectations of fu-ture performance, this figure differs from the value of the equity capital the company raised at the begin-ning, so a direct comparison of the size of the interest-bearing debt is not entirely accurate. 27 Source: www.kommuninvest.se/download/18.e6f1d6318fa4a7c94d1fd4e/1716973996911/Kommunin-vest Annual Report 2023 (xhtml).xhtml  28 Source: https://kommuninvest.se/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Den-kommunala-laneskulden-2023.pdf  (In Swedish only)', 'page_number': 5}, {'type': 'text', 'content': 'The real economy’s need for financial services \\n20 Figure 8.

Excluding equity capital. Source: Statistics Sweden.  Companies need financing to make investments and run their operations. The type of financing on which they have to pay interest is called interest-bearing debt and amounted to just over SEK 5,500 billion at the end of 2023. This is equivalent to just under Sweden’s annual GDP.

      "  Response: The size of a company significantly influences its borrowing methods in the Swedish non-financial sector. Larger companies often have greater access to various forms of financing compared to medium-sized and small companies. This disparity arises from several factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Access to Capital Markets**: Larger companies typically have the ability to issue debt securities, such as bonds, which allows them to tap into the capital markets for funding. This method of borrowing is more prevalent among larger firms, especially those in sectors like energy, water supply, and certain industrial operations. The ability to issue securities can provide these companies with more favorable borrowing terms and lower interest rates due to their established reputations and perceived lower risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Creditworthiness**: Larger companies generally have a more extensive credit history and stronger financial positions, which enhances their creditworthiness in the eyes of lenders. This can lead to easier access to loans and better terms compared to smaller companies, which may struggle to secure financing due to perceived higher risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Debt Composition**: Medium-sized and small companies primarily rely on traditional bank loans for financing. These smaller entities typically do not have the same level of resources or market presence to venture into issuing debt securities. Consequently, they are more dependent on bank relationships and loans, which can limit their flexibility and increase their cost of capital compared to larger firms that can diversify their funding sources.\n",
