        "retrieved_contexts": [],
        "generated_answer": "The difference in value between lamb and corn can be understood in terms of various factors such as market prices, nutritional value, and their roles in agriculture.\n\n1. **Market Prices**: The market price of lamb (a type of meat) tends to be significantly higher than that of corn (a grain). Prices can fluctuate based on supply and demand, seasonal changes, and regional availability. For example, as of late 2023, lamb prices might range from $4 to $10 per pound, while corn prices might range from $3 to $7 per bushel. \n\n2. **Nutritional Value**: Lamb is a rich source of protein, vitamins, and minerals, whereas corn is primarily a carbohydrate source. In terms of caloric density and nutritional value, lamb provides more protein and essential nutrients compared to corn.\n\n3. **Agricultural Role**: Corn is a staple crop used for animal feed, biofuel, and various food products, while lamb is typically produced for meat consumption. The economic value of corn can be significant due to its wide range of uses in the food industry and beyond.\n\n4. **Production Costs**: The cost of raising sheep for lamb is generally higher compared to growing corn, which can impact the market value of both products.\n\nIn summary, lamb typically has a higher market value compared to corn due to its nutritional profile and the costs associated with production. However, their values can vary based on specific market conditions and regional differences.",

According to the latest available data, Madagascar's GDP is significantly higher than that of Fiji.\n\n2. **Biodiversity**: Madagascar is known for its unique biodiversity, with many species found nowhere else on Earth. This ecological value could be considered \"greater\" than Fiji's, depending on the context.\n\n3. **Cultural and Historical Value**: Both countries have rich cultural heritages, but their values can be subjective and depend on personal or academic perspectives.\n\nIf you specify the type of value you're interested in (economic, environmental, cultural, etc.), I can provide a more precise comparison.",
