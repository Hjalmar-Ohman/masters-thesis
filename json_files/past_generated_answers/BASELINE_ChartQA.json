        "retrieved_contexts": [],
        "generated_answer": "The difference in value between lamb and corn can be analyzed from several perspectives, including market prices, nutritional value, and economic factors. \n\n1. **Market Prices**: The price of lamb is generally higher than that of corn because lamb is a meat product that requires more resources to produce, including feed, land, and care for livestock. Corn, being a staple grain and a major crop, is usually less expensive per unit weight.\n\n2. **Nutritional Value**: Lamb is a rich source of protein, vitamins (like B12), and minerals (like iron and zinc), while corn is primarily a carbohydrate source with some protein and fiber. The nutritional value difference can influence their market value and demand.\n\n3. **Economic Factors**: The value of both lamb and corn can fluctuate based on supply and demand, weather conditions, feed costs, and international trade. For instance, a drought affecting corn production could raise corn prices, while increased demand for lamb could elevate its price.\n\nTo get specific values, it's best to check current market prices for both lamb and corn, as they can vary significantly by region and over time.",
